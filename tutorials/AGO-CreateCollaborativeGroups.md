### Creating Groups where all members can update or edit content 
Regardless of who setups up the group, there is one setting that MUST be enabled at the creation of the Group. Most other settings can be modified after the creation, expect this one.
  The Setting:  "What items in the group can its members update?"
  
1. From the ArcGIS menu bar, select **Groups**
2. Click **Create Group**
3. If you have an image, you can upload it to the thumbnail. This is not necessary. If you do not upload an image, the default will take on the first letter used for the group name.
4. Provide a name for the group, a brief summary, and tags. Below are some guidelines as well as an example. 
    - **Group Name:** Use something meaningful and if you plan to do this assignment again in the future with a different group of individuals, think about adding the quarter or year to the group name.
    - **Summary:** A brief summary can expand on the title to provide a bit more information. For example, is the group intended for final projects only or for working on a project?
    - **Tags:**  will help individuals find this group when searching

 5. Set the remaining Group settings (see image below for one recommendtation):
    - **Who can view this group:** Unless you need content shared outside of the UCSD ArcGIS Online Organization, setting it to just "People in the organization (University of California San Diego) should be sufficient. If you have sensitive content that you don't want viewable to anyone inside the UCSD Org, you can set it to "only group members". The setting you choose here will limit the option "who can join the group". This setting can be changed after the group is created. 
    - **Who can join this group:**  will only display if you have enabled People inside the organization or Everyone to *view* the group. This setting can be changed after the group is created.
        - *Those who request membership and are approved by a group manager* means you open the group up to anyone can request to join, but approval must be granted by 1) the person who set the group up or 2) a group manager, a role assigned after you have more than just the creator of the group as a member.
        - *Only those invited by a group manager* you must manually invite all individuals to join the group. 
     - **Who can contribute to the group:** best to leave the default to group members. This setting can be changed after the group is created.
     - **What items in the group can its members update:** This is the setting that **CANNOT** be changed after a group is created. This is the setting you will need to change if you want individuals to colloabrate on StoryMaps. 
        - *Only their own items:* members cannot edit others' content shared with the group. You want this setting if students are working on their own StoryMaps.
        - *All items (group membership is limited to the organization):* This enables members to edit others' content. You want this setting if you want multiple individuals to work on the same StoryMap. Best practice if you have multiple teams, is for each team to have their own group. 
      - **Who can see the list of members on the Members tab:** best to leave the default to group members. This setting can be changed after the group is created.
      - You leave the defaults or modify the other settings based on your needs.
