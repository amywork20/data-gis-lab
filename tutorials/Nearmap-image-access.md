# Nearmap
UC San Diego has access to Nearmap imagery through the San Diego Imagery Consortium. San Diego Imagery Consortium is a 3-year agreement to access to Nearmap imagery and obliques for the entire U.S., dating back to 2014. Image availability varies across the U.S. 

Please refer to the [NearMap documentation for Integrations](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/INTEGRATIONS).

For use in Esri-based products, access to Nearmap imagery is automatically granted to all UC San Diego affiliates who log in to ArcGIS Online using the SSO option. If you would like to access Nearmap imagery in QGIS or other platforms, you will need to reach out to get an API key.
