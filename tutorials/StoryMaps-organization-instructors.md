#DRAFT in progress
The information below is to assist those instructors in managing some of the logists when using StoryMaps in class. These are suggestions, not absolute rules. You can modify as you see appropriate to your class setting.

## Tips to keep in mind
- Individual and group StoryMaps are possible. However, StoryMaps do not currently operate like Google, where multilpe people can be working on the same item at the same time. It will require coordination for who can be in working on the StoryMap at any given time. When someone is done working on their portion of the StoryMap, they should close the window. If a window is left open, it can cause issues for the next person who opens the StoryMap up to work on it. However, classes have had individuals work on their own as well as in groups.
- All StoryMaps are saved inside ArcGIS Online. For managing StoryMaps content for your class, you will want to work within ArcGIS Online. You can still use storymaps.arcgis.com for creating StoryMaps

## GROUP StoryMap assignments
*This setup will work to have individuals create one or more StoryMaps together. It's how the **Group** is setup that will determine if individuals can edit other's content, in this case a StoryMap.*
1. Individuals will need to setup a Group inside ArcGIS Online. This can be assigned to one group member or you can do this as the instructor.
