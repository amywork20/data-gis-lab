#DRAFT in progress
The information below is to assist those instructors in managing some of the logists when using StoryMaps in class. These are suggestions, not absolute rules. You can modify as you see appropriate to your class setting.

## Tips to keep in mind
- Individual and group StoryMaps are possible. 
- All StoryMaps are saved inside ArcGIS Online. For managing StoryMaps content for your class, you will want to work within ArcGIS Online. You can still use storymaps.arcgis.com for creating StoryMaps
- For Group StoryMaps, the thing to keep in mind is that you CANNOT have multiple people working on the StoryMap at the same time (e.g. StoryMaps do not currently operate like Google, where multilpe people can be working on the same item at the same time). If it's desired to have individuals work together to complete a single StoryMap, it will require coordination for who can work on the StoryMap at any given time. When someone is done working on their portion of the StoryMap, they should close the window. If a window is left open, it can cause issues for the next person who opens the StoryMap up to work on it. However, classes have had individuals work on their own as well as in groups.
- For Group StoryMaps, a group should be created for each group using the settings below. 
- For Individual StoryMaps, you can created a single group for the class. 
- At any point, you can create multiple groups. This might be appropriate if you want to have a "practice StoryMap submission" and a "Final Project Submission". Just be sure to name the groups accordingly.

# Creating StoryMaps
## Individuals will create their OWN StoryMap
1. Individuals can get started with creating StoryMaps immediately. 
  - Individuals must have logged into the UCSD ArcGIS Online Organization [ucsdonline.maps.arcgis.com](https://ucsdonline.maps.arcgis.com/) using their UCSD AD credentials. [Follow the steps in Option 1](https://ucsd.libguides.com/gis/arcgisaccount) to setup an account.
  - StoryMaps can be access from the main [UCSD ArcGIS Online Organization](https://ucsdonline.maps.arcgis.com/) using the keypad icon <img src="../images/Numberpad.png" width = 75> or directly from [Storymaps.arcgis.com](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/).

## GROUP StoryMap assignments
*This setup will work to have individuals create one or more StoryMaps together. It's how the **Group** is setup that will determine if individuals can edit other's content, in this case a StoryMap.*
1. Individuals will need to setup a Group inside ArcGIS Online. This task can be assigned to one group member or an instructor can do this.

### Creating a Group where all members can update or edit other's work 
Regardless of who setups up the group, there is one setting that MUST be enabled at the creation of the group. Most other settings can be modified after the creation, expect for this one setting.
  The Setting:  "What items in the group can its members update?"
  
1. From the ArcGIS menu bar, select **Groups**
2. Click **Create Group**
3. If you have an image, you can upload it to the thumbnail. This is not necessary. If you do not upload an image, the default will take on the first letter used for the group name.
4. Provide a name for the group, a brief summary, and tags. Below are some guidelines as well as an example. 
    - **Group Name:** Use something meaningful and if you plan to do this assignment again in the future with a different group of individuals, think about adding the quarter or year to the group name.
    - **Summary:** A brief summary can expand on the title to provide a bit more information. For example, is the group intended for final projects only or for working on a project?
    - **Tags:**  will help individuals find this group when searching

 5. Set the Group settings:
    - **Who can view this group:** Unless you need content shared outside of the UCSD ArcGIS Online Organization, setting it to just "People in the organization (University of California San Diego) should be sufficient. If you have sensitive content that you don't want viewable to anyone inside the UCSD Org, you can set it to "only group members". The setting you choose here will limit the option "who can join the group". This setting can be changed after the group is created. 
    - **Who can join this group:**  will only display if you have enabled People inside the organization or Everyone to *view* the group. This setting can be changed after the group is created.
        - *Those who request membership and are approved by a group manager* means you open the group up to anyone can request to join, but approval must be granted by 1) the person who set the group up or 2) a group manager, a role assigned after you have more than just the creator of the group as a member.
        - *Only those invited by a group manager* you must manually invite all individuals to join the group. 
     - **Who can contribute to the group:** best to leave the default to group members. This setting can be changed after the group is created.
     - **What items in the group can its members update:** This is the setting that CANNOT be changed after a group is created. This is the setting you will need to change if you want individuals to colloabrate on StoryMaps. 
        - *Only their own items:* members cannot edit others' content shared with the group. You want this setting if students are working on their own StoryMaps.
        - *All items (group membership is limited to the organization):* This enables members to edit others' content. You want this setting if you want multiple individuals to work on the same StoryMap. Best practice for
