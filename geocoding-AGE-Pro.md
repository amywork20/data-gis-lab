# Geocoding in ArcGIS Enterprise #
This document will take you through the steps required to connect to ArcGIS Enterprise (AGE) and conduct a geocoding task. You can geocode data using the AGE web browser, or connect to the AGE server through the ArcGIS Pro software. 

## Connecting to the UC San Diego Virtual Private Network ##
To use ArcGIS Enterprise, make sure to first download the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and use UCSD's virtual private network (VPN) service. You can find more information [here](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/). 

You will need to connect to the VPN before you log into and access AGE. 

## Geocoding from ArcGIS Pro using AGE ##
1. Open up your project on ArcGIS Pro and navigate to the “Insert” tab on the ribbon. In this tab, you should see an icon called “Connections”. Search the dropdown menu and Select “New ArcGIS Server”.
